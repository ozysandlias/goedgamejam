Goed Game Jam 13 Submission by TBD Games
---------------------------------------
Description

Our concept is a game about a train breaking free from an endless loop of rails by exploring, improving your train, and defeating increasingly stronger waves of enemies.

The player commands a cannon mounted atop their mighty locomotive which they can use to change rail switches, attack enemies, and gather resources.

The ultimate goal is to find a way off the endless rails, but no matter how many routes they explore, it seems like every line loops back on itself. Maybe deeper underground lies a secret line, forgotten by time, which could guide them to a new station filled with riches and an end to their perilous journey

2/25/25: Created a basic 3d platformer template in godot and initialized repository to prepare for jam.
2/28/25: Our team is finalized. Myself (Ozysandlias) and Hangjo will be doing the programming, and Chaekers and Jayden will be handling 2D and 3D art respectively. We may bring in one other member for audio or I may try handling it. We came up with a few ideas and settled on looping trains/rollercoasters for our concept. Something roguelike esque with a focus on exploration and "on rails" shooting
3/1/25: Created a pathfinding system in godot which guides the train as well as a method for adding additional carts to the train
